## Question 8

a)

Newton's second law:
$$
F = ma = mg - kx
$$

Thus
$$
\ddot{x} + \frac{k}{m}x = g
$$

b)

The general homogenous solution is of the form
$$
x_h = A \sin (\omega t + \phi)
$$

with $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$.

I guess that a particular solution is in the form $x_p = P$ for some $P \in \mathbb{R}$. Substituting in the motion equation we get that
$$
\frac{k}{m}P = g \Rightarrow P = \frac{mg}{k}
$$

Overall, we got the general solution $x = x_h + x_p$:
$$
x = A \sin (\omega t + \phi) + \frac{mg}{k}
$$

Differentiating we get
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot x &= \omega A \cos (\omega t + \phi) \\
\ddot x &= - \omega^2 A \sin (\omega t + \phi)
\end{align*}
$$

It is verifiable that the $x$ we found satisfies the differential equation.

Initial velocity is 0, thus
$$
\dot x(0) = 0 = \omega A \cos (\phi) \Rightarrow \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}
$$

Initial position is 0, thus
$$
x(0) = 0 = A \sin (\frac{\pi}{2}) + \frac{mg}{k} \Rightarrow A = -\frac{mg}{k}
$$

Finally:
$$
x = \frac{mg}{k} \Bigl( 1 - \sin (\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t + \frac{\pi}{2}) \Bigr)
$$

c)

There is some $t$ such that $\sin(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t + \frac{\pi}{2}) = -1, at those $t$ $x$ is maximal. Thus:

The maximum compression is $\frac{mg}{k}(1 - (-1)) = \frac{2mg}{k}$.
