## Question 2

a) 

$$
[a t^2] = [a] s^2 = m/s \Rightarrow [a] = m/s^3
$$

$$
[b t] = [b] s = m/s \Rightarrow [b] = m/s^2
$$

$$
[c] = m/s
$$

b)

The position vector $r(t)$ is given by
$$
\vec{r}(t) = \int \vec{v}(t) dt = \frac{a}{3}t^3i -bt^2j + ctk + r_0
$$

where $r_0$ is some constant.

c)

$$
\vec{r}(0) = (l, 0, l) = r_0
$$

Therefore
$$
\vec{r}(t) = \int \vec{v}(t) dt = (\frac{a}{3}t^3 + l)i -bt^2j + (ct + l)k
$$

d)

The acceleration vector $\vec{a}(t)$ is given by
$$
\vec{a}(t) = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = 2ati - 2bj
$$
