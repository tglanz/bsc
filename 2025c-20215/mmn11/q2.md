## Question 2

a) 

$$
[a t^2] = [a] s^2 = m/s \Rightarrow [a] = m/s^3
$$

$$
[b t] = [b] s = m/s \Rightarrow [b] = m/s^2
$$

$$
[c] = m/s
$$

b)

> Note: I don't necessary use $\vec{\cdot}$ to denote vectors when it is understood from context.

The position vector $r(t)$ is given by
$$
r(t) = \int v(t) dt = \frac{a}{3}t^3i -bt^2j + ctk + r_0
$$

where $r_0$ is some constant.

c)

$$
r(0) = (l, 0, l) = r_0
$$

Therefore
$$
r(t) = \int v(t) dt = (\frac{a}{3}t^3 + l)i -bt^2j + (ct + l)k
$$

d)

The acceleration vector $a(t)$ is given by
$$
a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = 2ati - 2bj
$$
