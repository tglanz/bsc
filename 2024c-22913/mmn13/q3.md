# Q3

From
$$
A \ominus B = \{ z | B_z \subseteq A \}
$$

we get that if $z \in A \ominus B$ then forall $b \in B$
$$
    z + b \in A
$$

Observe that according to the definition of translation we get that
$$
    A_{-b} = \{ a - b | a \in A \} = \{ x | x + b \in A \}
$$

so we conclude that $z \in A_{-b}$ for all $b \in B$ and therefore
$$
    A \ominus B \subseteq \bigcap_{b \in B} A_{-b}
$$

On the other hand, if $z \in \bigcap_{b \in B} A_{-b}$ then for all $b \in B$
$$
    z \in A_{-b}
$$

and with similar arguments we get that forall $z + b \in A$ and therefore by definition
$$
    B_z \subseteq A
$$

which means that $z \in A \ominus B$ so
$$
    \bigcap_{b \in B} A_{-b} \subseteq A \ominus B
$$

Because we have shown inclusion from both sides we conclude equality.
