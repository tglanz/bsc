# Introduction

In this chapter, we will shallowly review the deep compression landscape. Our focus in this work is the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis and the lottery tickets themselves - The hypothesis uses pruning, which is a technique in the deep compression field. Therefore, we don't need to delve too much into other deep compression techniques, only review them to give a full picture.

## TODO - below are only leftovers from the outline

- What is deep compression?
- Motivation for deep compression
- The standard deep compression pipeline
  - Pruning
  - Quantization
  - Huffman Coding
- Modern/Novel compression techniques
  - Error Bounded Lossy Compression 

Note: If, during writing the work, we find that there is not enough substance (focusing on pruning and the lottery ticket hypothesis alone), we can dive deeper into the other techniques as well.
